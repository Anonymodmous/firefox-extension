It offers free and paid Internet-accessible storage space and bandwidth. It allows you to store and access your files from within your web browser or through dedicated client applications.","264":"To the best of our knowledge, cloud storage and encryption are legal. Please comply with applicable laws and regulations on [B]how[\/B] you use cloud storage and encryption as well as our [A]terms of use[\/A].","265":"MEGA was made by the same people that had previously run one of the world's largest cloud storage businesses. Can I please have my account and my files back?","266":"Unfortunately, MEGA has no access to any of the assets that its employees have created previously. There is no legal connection and no recycling of any code, hardware or database records, and we therefore currently see no way of recovering your legacy data.","267":"Why base a cloud storage company in New Zealand, of all places?","268":"Among other important reasons, New Zealand's native M\u0101ori name is \"Aotearoa\", which means \"Land of the long white cloud\".","269":"Can I access MEGA on my mobile device?","270":"You can access MEGA through your mobile browser, but this severely limits performance and functionality. We recommend using our dedicated mobile app for your device instead.","271":"Can I resume interrupted up- or downloads?","272":"Yes, as long as you do not close the browser tab, up- and downloads will resume automatically after e.g. a network interruption or your device having entered standby\/sleep mode. Please note that our servers automatically discard incomplete uploads after 48 hours of inactivity.","273":"Can I upload the same file multiple times?","274":"Because the server can't see filenames, filename collisions have to be dealt with on the client side. With standard settings, if you upload a file that you already seem to have in your account (same target path\/filename, same size, same last modification time), it is skipped, but nothing prevents you from keeping multiple files or folders with the same name in the same folder.","275":"How do you regulate bandwidth utilization?","276":"Our policy is not to impose any artificial restrictions on our users unless necessitated by infrastructure bottlenecks.  We therefore reserve the right to cap user bandwidth utilization for operational reasons at any time on a per-IP basis. Your transfer queue will resume automatically once the congestion eases. No manual intervention is required.","277":"Are there any file size limits on MEGA?","278":"We do not impose artificial file size limits other than your available cloud drive space. While all current browsers are capable of uploading large files, downloading is size-constrained with Internet Explorer and Safari due to their incomplete HTML5 support.","279":"Can I upload and download at the same time?","280":"Yes. One upload and one download per browser tab can run in parallel.","281":"Why don't you provide image thumbnails or streamed previewing of video and audio files?","282":"Because our end-to-end encryption model inherently precludes any server-side manipulation of your data, which would be required to implement such a feature.","283":"How do I upload files to MEGA?","284":"There are three ways of uploading files to MEGA using your web browser:","285":"1. Click on the red button on the start page","286":"2.\tGo to your file manager and click on the \"File Upload\" or (if you're using Chrome) \"Folder \tUpload\" buttons near the top","287":"3. Drag and drop files or (if you're using Chrome) folders onto the site","288":"How do I install MEGA?","289":"MEGA can be used with any modern web browser. However, depending on your specific browser's capabilities, some features may be unavailable - we strongly recommend using Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Opera Next. Advanced functionality such as automated folder synchronization or filesystem mounts will be made available through installable client applications.","290":"How does folder sharing work?","291":"You can share any subtree of your cloud drive with friends, family or coworkers. Invitation is by e-mail address. Invitees who do not have an account yet will receive an e-mail notification with a signup link. Alternatively, you can create a public link to any of your folders and export the folder-specific crypto key, making it accessible without a MEGA account. It is then your responsibility to securely transmit the folder key to the recipient(s).","292":"To establish, modify or delete a share, simply right click on a folder in your file manager and select Sharing. There are three access levels: Read-only, read\/write (files can be added, but not deleted), and full (files can be added and deleted).","293":"If you added an e-mail address that did not have an account yet, you need to be online at least once after the recipient completes the signup process so that you can encrypt the share secret to his newly created public key.","294":"How do I delete people from my shared folder?","295":"Simply right click on a folder in your file manager and select sharing. You will see all people that currently have access to the shared folder. Right click on the person and choose the Delete option from the menu.","296":"How do I recognize my shared folders?","297":"Shared folders in your file manager have a special icon with a hand below the folder.","298":"Can I share folders that were shared with me?","299":"No. Folder shares are non-transitive.","302":"How do I link to a file on MEGA?","303":"First of all, a word of caution: The cryptographic security of your files depends on the confidentiality of the associated encryption keys. Make sure that you transmit them via protected channels only! Standard e-mail, for example, is not good enough.","304":"With that in mind, select one or multiple files in your file manager, then right-click and use \"Get link\". A dialog with the public link(s) to the file(s) you have selected will open. You can choose to export each link and key separately or as a single combo link.","305":"How does the encryption work?","306":"All encryption is end-to-end. Data uploaded is encrypted on the uploading device before it is sent out to the Internet, and data downloaded is decrypted only after it has arrived on the downloading device.  The client machines are responsible for generating, exchanging and managing the encryption keys. No usable encryption keys ever leave the client computers (with the exception of RSA public keys).","307":"Is all of my personal information subject to encryption?","308":"No. Only file data and file\/folder names are encrypted. Information that we need operational access to, such as your e-mail address, IP address, folder structure, file ownership and payment credentials, are stored and processed unencrypted. Please see our privacy policy for details.","309":"Is my stored data absolutely secure?","310":"All security is relative. The following attack vectors exist - they are not specific to MEGA, but we want you to know about the risks: ","311":"Individual accounts are jeopardized by:","312":"- Spyware on your computer. A simple keylogger is enough, but session credentials and keys could also be extracted from memory or the filesystem.","313":"- Shoulder surfing. Do not type your password while someone could watch your keystrokes.","314":"- Password brute-forcing. Use strong passwords.","315":" - Phishing. Always confirm the security status of your connection (https:\/\/) and the correct domain name (mega.co.nz) before entering your password.","316":"Large-scale attacks could be mounted through:","317":"- A \"man in the middle\" attack. Requires issuing a valid duplicate SSL certificate in combination with DNS forging and\/or attacks on our BGP routes (a DigiNotar-style scenario).","318":"- Gaining access to the webservers hosting https:\/\/mega.co.nz\/index.html and replacing that file with a forged version (this would not affect access through the installed app base). Note that manipulating content on our distributed static content CDN does not pose a security risk, as all active content loaded from index.html is subject to verification with a cryptographic hash (think of it as some kind of \"secure boot\" for websites). This type of attack requires sending malicious code to the client and is therefore detectable.","319":"- Gaining access to our core server infrastructure and creating forged key requests on existing shares. This type of attack only affects data in accounts with shared folders and is detectable on the client side as well.","320":"What if I don't trust you? Is it still safe for me to use MEGA?","321":"If you don't trust us, you cannot run any code provided by us, which precludes opening MEGA in your browser and entering your login credentials. However, due to MEGA's end-to-end encryption paradigm, you can safely use client applications written by someone you trust.","322":"I trust you and your New Zealand data centre, but I don't trust your German data centre, because it is run by a US company.  Is it still safe for me to use MEGA?","323":"Yes, you can still use MEGA (with a few limitations) safely with our core datacentre in Germany being fully compromised. The New Zealand data centre makes sure that no rogue code can run when you visit https:\/\/mega.co.nz\/.","324":"Is data that I put in shared folders as secure my other data?","325":"Shared folders, by nature, are only as secure as their least secure member. However, a compromise of our core server infrastructure poses an additional risk: Public keys could be manipulated, and key requests could be forged.","326":"Let's assume that a MEGA storage node is physically compromised. What are the risks?","327":"Error messages after downloading manipulated files. Even if the attacker had the encryption key for a given file on that node, he could still not replace it with a forged one without causing the subsequent downloads to fail.","328":"Is it a good idea to store all of my data in a single place?","329":"Always keep redundant copies of important files, online and offline. Although we keep each file in at least two locations, there is no guarantee against multiple concurrent failures and repeated unprecedented government misconduct.","330":"Why should I entrust my data to, of all people, you?","331":"We provide for user controlled encryption (UCE) where you, the user, control the keys. The UCE implementation is open source, and we invite and encourage the community to scrutinize it and provide feedback. We believe that this approach is much safer than storing your data on a provider with server-side encryption where the ISP controls the keys or, worse, no encryption at all - if, for example, MEGA user files were suddenly accessible without a password due to a programming error, they would be unreadable without the user-controlled decryption keys.","332":"I noticed that you are using HTTPS for transferring already encrypted file data. Isn't that redundant?","333":"It is. Unfortunately, most browsers take offence with establishing insecure connections from a secure page, and who could blame them for that - they can't possibly be aware of the fact that there is another encryption layer already in operation. Because HTTPS has an adverse effect on performance, we allow you to turn it off on browsers that allow it (Chrome, Safari and Firefox until version 17) to speed up your transfers without jeopardizing the confidentiality or integrity of your data. You will see an SSL warning appear upon your first file transfer in some browsers - in this (and only in this) case, it is safe to ignore.","334":"What encryption algorithms does MEGA use internally?","335":"For bulk transfers, AES-128 (we believe that the higher CPU utilization of AES-192 and AES-256 outweighs the theoretical security benefit, at least until the advent of quantum computers). Post-download integrity checking is done through a chunked variation of CCM, which is less efficient than OCB, but not encumbered by patents.","336":"For establishing shared secrets between users and dropping files into your inbox, RSA-2048 (the key length was chosen as middle grounds between \"too insecure\" and \"too slow\"). All encryption, decryption and key generation is implemented in JavaScript, which limits throughput to a few MB\/s and causes significant CPU load. We are looking forward to the implementation of the proposed HTML5 WebCrypto API in all major browsers, which will eliminate this bottleneck.","337":"JavaScript's built-in random number generator is enhanced through a mouse\/keyboard timing-driven RC4 entropy pool as well as crypto.* randomness where available (Chrome and Firefox only at the moment - keys generated by Internet Explorer and Safari are less secure than they could be).","338":"Does MEGA keep backups of my files?","339":"We store your files on at least two servers in different datacentres, if available.","340":"I have forgotten my password. Can I reset it?","341":"Unfortunately, your MEGA password is not just a password - it is the master encryption key to all of your data. If you lose it, you lose access to all of your files that are not in a shared folder and that you have no previously exported file or folder key for.","344":"When do I need to upgrade to a Pro account?","345":"A Pro account gives you additional storage space and extra bandwidth quota that we automatically draw from whenever an operational bandwidth limit is reached - you can use the quota yourself, or grant it to third parties accessing your data (this includes users without a MEGA account).  The maximum percentage of your bandwidth quota allocated to third parties is configurable in your account settings.","346":"What is the upload speed limiting feature good for?","347":"Many routers do not prioritize smaller packets in case of link congestion, resulting in your inbound traffic being severely affected when your outbound link is full. We therefore offer an automatic speed management option where we measure your available outbound bandwidth during the initial ten seconds of an upload and then keep at least 10% of it unused. You can also set a fixed throughput limit.","348":"What do I get with my free account?","349":"A globally accessible, high-performance, secure cloud drive with [X] of storage space. If you need more than that, you can upgrade to a [A1]Pro[\/A1] account. Click [A2]here[\/A2] to see your current utilization.","359":"Do you offer an API?","361":"Yes. Please use our software development kit to add MEGA support to your application.","362":"To prevent resource overload, we sometimes have to cap bandwidth utilization. The file you are trying to download is larger than our current limit of [X3]. Its transfer has been postponed and will start automatically once the congestion eases.","365":"Your browser is not modern enough to download a file this large.","366":"Copyright warning","367":"MEGA respects the copyrights of others and requires that users of the MEGA cloud service comply with the laws of copyright. You are strictly prohibited from using the MEGA cloud service to infringe copyrights. You may not upload, download, store, share, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, transmit or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.","368":"Caution:","369":"MEGA's cryptographic security model depends on the confidentiality of the keys displayed above.
